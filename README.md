# Bruno Dinello

Supply Chain & Data Science | Machine Learning & AI (MSc candidate) | Python

I build data-driven solutions for retail operations and logistics—combining analytics, machine learning, and optimization to improve service levels, inventory, and decision-making.

## What I focus on
- Demand forecasting & inventory/replenishment analytics
- Assortment and stock allocation optimization (constraints, trade-offs)
- Applied ML/AI: end-to-end projects with reproducible pipelines
- Lightweight MLOps: APIs, packaging, testing, and deployment basics

## Featured projects
- **Forecasting + Replenishment (end-to-end)** — baseline vs improved models, evaluation, and a simple reorder policy  
  Repo: https://github.com/TU_USUARIO/forecasting-replenishment-playbook

- **Assortment Optimization Demo** — recommendation signals + constrained optimization to select store-SKU mix  
  Repo: https://github.com/TU_USUARIO/assortment-optimization-demo

- **FastAPI ML Inference Template** — clean project structure, tests, Docker-ready inference API  
  Repo: https://github.com/TU_USUARIO/fastapi-ml-inference

- **Computer Vision Demo (Retail context)** — a small CV project with clear metrics + demo notebook  
  Repo: https://github.com/TU_USUARIO/cv-retail-demo

## Tech stack
**Python**, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, SQL, Tableau  
FastAPI, Docker (basics), GitHub Actions (basics)
